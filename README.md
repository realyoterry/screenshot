# Screenshot

Chrome Extension to screenshot in full screen, or selected area.

## How it works

This extension captures full screen by using Chrome's built-in `captureVisibleTabs()` function. To capture a selected area, it first captures the whole screen, crops the image using the HTML `Image` class so only the selected area is left.

Here's a video preview of the extension:
